    "# Pythonic code\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythonic\" code refers to code that adheres to the conventions and idioms of the Python programming language, and uses its features effectively. This code is often seen as more readable, maintainable, and expressive compared to code written in a different style or using a different programming language. The idea behind \"Pythonic\" code is to write code that is both efficient and elegant, by taking advantage of the language's strengths and features (source: ChatGPT ;))\n",
    "## Zen of Python\n",
    "The \"Zen of Python\" is a collection of 19 aphorisms that provide guidance on writing computer programs in the Python programming language. It was written by Tim Peters, one of the earliest contributors to the Python language. The \"Zen of Python\" is not a formal specification or standard, but rather a set of guidelines and suggestions for writing \"Pythonic\" code. Some of the most famous aphorisms from the \"Zen of Python\" include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Beautiful is better than ugly.\"\n",
    "\"Explicit is better than implicit.\"\n",
    "\"Simple is better than complex.\"\n",
    "\"Complex is better than complicated.\"\n",
    "\"Readability counts.\"\n",
    "The \"Zen of Python\" can be accessed within a Python interpreter by running the command \"import this\"."
